            <p>But we forgot our toys in our childhood. Hopefully my friend Robin from my Hood is going to get anything he wants and will experience pleasure. I want him to be happy and going forward.</p>

            <p>Although i already have something to do i still want to know where the world is going when it is true. I want to be the one who can help saving the pretty shines of light i see.</p>

            <h2>Hi im Marky</h2>
            <p>Hi im Marky, i hope im good and trying not to get lost. However, this sems to be hard when you are in the moment of strong bad feeling and in the same moment you're trying to rethink your behaviour to good one. Nonetheless it looks like sometimes i succeed and it is good!</p>

            <h2>Strange feeling but would i stop?</h2>
            <p>I got a strange feeling, i make no money without a job and i have chosen to be a programmer, so i planned to learn and find one.
            It is not comfortable not having to do something for a reward and type a code you almost know in the midst of a daytime. It is useful to dispose of your bad habits and get in your better working conditions without no distractions. Yet without strict plans for going to useful places it is less enjoyable. When i had a job i had a good day everyday, including holidays.
